## Install

You should install with NuGet:

```bash
Install-Package LogSnag.NET
```

Or via the .NET Core command line interface:

```bash
dotnet add package LogSnag.NET
```

## How to use

```c#
ILogSnagClient client = new LogSnagClient("token");
```

Or with your own HttpClient

```c#
ILogSnagClient client = new LogSnagClient(new HttpClient(), "token");
```

### Publish event

```c#
await client.Publish(new LogSnagEvent("project", "channel", "event")
{
    Tags =
    {
        new LogSnagTag("tag-one", 1),
        new LogSnagTag("tag-two", "val2"),
        new LogSnagTag("tag-bool", true)
    },
    Icon = "ðŸ«¡",
    Description = "This is an event",
    Notify = true,
    Parser = LogSnagParser.Text
});
```

### Publish insight

```c#
await client.Insight(new LogSnagInsight("project", "title", "value")
{
    Icon = "ðŸ‘Œ"
});
```

## Dependency Injection (`IHttpClientFactory`)

Given you're in an application environment with access to an `IServiceCollection` container you can use this package instead:

```bash
dotnet add package LogSnag.NET.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
```

Which allows one to register `ILogSnagClient` coupled to a [managed HttpClient](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests):

```c#
builder.Services.AddLogSnagClient("token");
```
